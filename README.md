CS-250 Sprint Review and Retrospective 
CS-250 Agile Presentation

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The most essential step in understanding user needs when developing a program is to understand the client's vision with an initial meetup meeting and then follow up meetings throughout the process to ensure, with constant testing, that the project remains on track. The user stories assist with keeping this process on track because they lead the Team to understand the questions that arise throughout and are a platform for clarification and progress to develop.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  The agile process is natural and almost second nature to me at this point and I will continue to follow along with user stories and daily scrum meetings to ensure communication remains strong and testing occurs throughout the process.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  A good Team member is supportive, self motivated, drives improvement, is communicative, keeps a positive attitude, and keeps moving the project forward.
